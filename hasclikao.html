                Heartaches, heartaches
                My loving you meant only heartaches
                Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me
                I can't believe it's just a burning memory

                Heartaches, heartaches
                What does it matter how my heart breaks?
                I should be happy with someone new
                But my heart aches for you
